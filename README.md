# agile_monkeys_api
API REST for agile monkeys (test)

Hi! 

This is an API REST created for a shop, based in the following technologies:

- Python
- Flask
- SQLAlchemy
- Postgres

Here you may find packages installed for this:

- flask-sqlalchemy 
- flask-jwt-extended 
- flask-migrate 
- psycopg2 
- flask-cors 
- requests 
- flask 
- sqlalchemy 
- cloudinary 
- flask-dotenv 
- flask-serialize 

 # Instructions:

 Once you activate your virtual environment, just need to run the command:

- Flask run

Then you are able to start with your preferred API REST tool: 

- Thunder client (vscode extension, highly recommended)
- Postman
- Insomnia

I would recommend you creating a user as admin, setting it as follows:
